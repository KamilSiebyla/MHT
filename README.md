## Project Details

I have created an application (for this event needs I am using .NET/Blazor) which will allow me to see instantly if person I am looking will be available soon - and if someone will be available I will show the time slots when there is possibility to reach out with option to quick message on Teams/E-mail with some simple message.

### Purpose
Nowdays I am usually checking folks calendars and I am trying to see when they will be able to talk with me. It is usually time consuming I just wanted to have compact overview of my week and also ability to quickly check avaialabilty time slots of my collegues.

### Future plans
My plan after this hack is to incorporate this feature to MS Teams in the end to actually use it on daily basis.
