## Project Details

I have created an application (for this event needs I am using .NET/Blazor) which will allow me to see instantly if person I am looking will be available soon - and if someone will be available I will show the time slots when there is possibility to reach out with option to quick message on Teams/E-mail with some simple message.

### Purpose
Nowdays I am usually checking folks calendars and I am trying to see when they will be able to talk with me. It is usually time consuming I just wanted to have compact overview of my week and also ability to quickly check avaialabilty time slots of my collegues.

### Project structure
Project structure is looking standard. There are few additional folders with business logic. Here is solution structure:

From SDK point of view most important are "Factories", "Providers" and "Services" under "Infrastructure".

### Branching strategy
There is standard git flow implemented with RELEASE (will be created for first release), MASTER, DEVELOPEMENT and FEATURE branches. 

### Future plans
My plan after this hack is to incorporate this feature to MS Teams in the end to actually use it on daily basis. 

### Flow description

1. First thing user will see is login page:

2. When log-in process will finish - user will see the view with upcoming meetings:

And here is screen dump from the outlook calendar - events are aligned: 
![alt text](https://github.com/KamilSiebyla/MHT/blob/11896ce7b10aa4d8cfbcfddb09a6a5f2c0c956d7/MHT/wwwroot/flow_images/2_calendar_outllok_after_login_page.png?raw=true)

What is important here are borders for each event. There are three colors: 
- RED: It means, that meeting will take place in less than one day; 
- YELLOW: Meeting will take place beetwen tommorow or day after tommorw;
- GREEN: Meeting will take place after more than two days;

3. After clicking "Check presence" in navbar, user will be moved to new page with search:
![alt text](https://github.com/KamilSiebyla/MHT/blob/11896ce7b10aa4d8cfbcfddb09a6a5f2c0c956d7/MHT/wwwroot/flow_images/5_search_coworkers_result.png?raw=true)

In this step, there is "Gu" in searchbox. What application is doing here - it is calling graph with search term to find people in logged-in user organization. Borders for users are suggesting, that they are offline. 

4. Below example of the same result after changing users statuses:

*Box on user card is showing meetings schedule for the user (for now it is mocked data due to some problems with fetchin particular user calendar and events. I have raised question in QA section.)*

5. Now, let's click "Teams" button and try to send message to active user: 
![alt text](https://github.com/KamilSiebyla/MHT/blob/11896ce7b10aa4d8cfbcfddb09a6a5f2c0c956d7/MHT/wwwroot/flow_images/7_send_teams_message_click.png?raw=true)

6. Results of sending teams message:
![alt text](https://github.com/KamilSiebyla/MHT/blob/11896ce7b10aa4d8cfbcfddb09a6a5f2c0c956d7/MHT/wwwroot/flow_images/9_success_message_to_pradeep.png?raw=true)

7. Now, let's try to do same thing for an e-mail:
![alt text](https://github.com/KamilSiebyla/MHT/blob/11896ce7b10aa4d8cfbcfddb09a6a5f2c0c956d7/MHT/wwwroot/flow_images/8_send_outllok_message.png?raw=true)

8. Results of sending an e-mail:
![alt text](https://github.com/KamilSiebyla/MHT/blob/11896ce7b10aa4d8cfbcfddb09a6a5f2c0c956d7/MHT/wwwroot/flow_images/10_success_mail_to_pradeep.png?raw=true)

This is basically whole flow. It is allowing to have quick overview of our and our collegues presences and effectivelly start dialog when we want to have a word with a particular person.
